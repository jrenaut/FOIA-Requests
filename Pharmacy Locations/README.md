##What I requested:
>All licensed pharmacies as of August 1, 2016 in Washington, DC including license number, pharmacy name, and address. 
>Essentially, I would like the most up to date version possible of this document:
>http://doh.dc.gov/publication/list-licensed-dc-pharmacies
>If you are unable to create the report as of August 1, 2016 please let me know the latest date possible the report can be created. 

##What I received:
Oh. boy. First I received [an image PDF](https://github.com/katerabinowitz/FOIA-Requests/blob/master/Pharmacy%20Locations/FOIA%20Request%20-%20DC%20Pharmacies%20(Rabinowitz)%202016-FOIA-04908.pdf), 
which is to say they printed out an Excel sheet, scanned it, and sent that to me. I explained and asked for a native PDF or the Excel. They [kindly provided a native PDF,](https://github.com/katerabinowitz/FOIA-Requests/blob/master/Pharmacy%20Locations/DC%20Resident%20Pharmacies_8%205%202016.pdf),
the format of which is bit iffy. *Please note I deleted the last four pages of the PDF because it included personal email addresses of the pharmacy contacts.*

##What I've done (so far):
Plan to convert to .csv
