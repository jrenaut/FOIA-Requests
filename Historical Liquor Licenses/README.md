##What I requested:
>District of Columbia ABC Licensees from 2005 to present including the following: license number, status, applicant, trade name, address, SMD, class, description, date of license start, and date of license end.  
>(essentially the historical versions of this: http://abra.dc.gov/page/abc-licensees)

##What I received:
ABRA really came through here! At first I don't think they understood my request but when I explained they fairly promptly sent over exactly what I was looking for, and not in PDF.

##What I've done (so far):
Will consolidate to single timeline
